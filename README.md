## Notes About the Map
This map was created to determine the level to which proximity to a mine affects the water quality of lakes and streams within the BWCA. This map is important because the issues of mining leases and pollution seem to arrive in the BWCA every year and are constantly under threat. It was created using QGIS and extracting attributes by location as well as spatial joins of water quality data.
Based on this map, further questions can be answered through more study of exactly what kind of impairment these lakes are afflicted by and mapping the corresponding contaminants/pollutants on each lake. 
It is hard to separate the mining industry and the Iron Range. A solution to the problems of pollution would leaving thousands of people without jobs. However, a continuation of the status quo could result in the destruction of a treasured resource.
